| Requirement ID | Description                        | User Story                                                                                                                     | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001          | Define new set of faux member data | As a user, I want to be able to define a new set of faux member data.                                                          | The system should provide a clear way for the user to initiate the creation of a new data set, potentially presenting an empty view or an "add new data set" button. |
| FR002          | Customize how to create faux data  | As a user, I want to be able to customize how the faux member data is generated, so it can reflect my specific use case.       | The system should provide an input field or mechanism for users to specify geography, age, and other demographics of the faux member data.                           |
| FR003          | Viewing faux members in a List     | As a user, I want to be able to see all the faux members I have added to my data set so I can review and manage them.          | The system should display the faux member data, potentially with map views of addresses and similar visualisations.                                                  |
| FR004          | Editing faux member data           | As a user, I want to be able to edit faux member data in my data set if I see an error or want to manually customize the data. | The system should provide a way for users to modify the data of an existing faux member in the data set.                                                             |
| FR005          | Deleting faux member data          | As a user, I want to be able to remove a faux member from my data if no longer relevant or needed                              | The system should provide a mechanism for users to delete individual faux members from their data.                                                                   |
| FR006          | Storing faux member data locally   | As a user, I want to be able to download faux member data for local use.                                                       | The system should provide a button to download faux member data locally, potentially a drop down so the desired file format can be chosen.                           |
| FR007          | Viewing members in a grid view   | As a user, I want to be able to view the generated members in a grid view.                                                       | The system should provide a button to switch between the default list view and a grid view.                           |
